# pdf_masterlist
A stand-alone application to create master lists from PDFs

# WIP
I paused this project, because the PDF I was reading from turned out to be highly inconsistent. I'd have to write an entire logic tree to paste relevant, incomplete paragraphs together.
In addition the reading order is inherently inconsistent as well.
I may or may not revisit this.
